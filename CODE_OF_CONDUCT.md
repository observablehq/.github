# Code of Conduct

By participating in this project in any way, including but not limited to submitting or commenting on an issue or pull request, you are agreeing to comply with the Observable Code of Conduct (CoC), reproduced here for convenience; please refer to https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/code-of-conduct for the up-to-date official document.

 ## Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming and inclusive environment the Observable team and its moderators pledge that participation in our platform and our community is a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. 

We pledge to prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone”, “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you” and other criticisms.

Observable pledges to uphold the standard of this Code of Conduct.  

 ## Standards
**Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

**Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:**

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Racism of any kind
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Dismissing or attacking inclusion-oriented requests

## Our Responsibility

Observable is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior as stated in this code of conduct and the [terms of service](https://observablehq.com/terms-of-service). We take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Observable and its moderators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject any form of contributions or communications that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently anyone for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all Observable platform spaces and communication channels as well as public spaces when an individual is representing Observable and/or our community. This means that outside of the Observable platform, if there is a reasonable belief that an individual’s behavior may have a negative impact on Observable and/or its community, Observable and its moderators are within their rights to uphold the Code of Conduct as they see fit.

 ## Reporting Process & Enforcement

Code of Conduct violations may be reported by sending an email to <conduct@observablehq.com>. We investigate every complaint, but may not send a direct response to each complaint. We use discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents. In potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing harassment or threats to anyone’s safety, we may take action without notice.

As stated above, Observable and its moderators have the right and responsibility to remove comments or other contributions and/ or to suspend (temporarily or permanently) anyone for other behaviors that violate this Code of Conduct.
