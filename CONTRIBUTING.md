# How to contribute to Observable

Thanks for using Observable! If you want to get involved or make a contribution to the codebase, please read these guidelines first.

#### Did you find a bug?

* **Make sure the bug was not already reported** by searching open & closed Github Issues for related terms.

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new issue. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number.

#### Do you want to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* Suggest your change in the [Observable forum](https://talk.observablehq.com/) to discuss your idea with our team and user community.

* Wait until you have collected positive feedback about the suggested change from members of the Observable team before opening a new Github issue or submitting a pull request. 

#### **Do you have questions about the platform or its source code?**

* Ask any question about how Observable works or how to use it in the [forum](https://talk.observablehq.com/).
* Or if you prefer, email [support@observablehq.com](mailto:support@observablehq.com) and our team will get back to you.

**Thank you!**
